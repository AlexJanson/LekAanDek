# **Lek Aan Dek**

###### *This project is part of the final exam.*

Lek aan dek is a short experience in which the user needs to get to the end of the level within a short timeframe.
Throughout the level there are a few challanges which the player has to overcome.
The game's goal is to get people interested in the marine.
You can take a look at the game in this cool video [right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjVVfgfvyxg&feature=youtu.be)!


We also use Ryan Hipplesâ€™ game architecture with scriptable objects to achieve a truly independent workflow.



*You can download the latest compiled build from the [release tab](https://github.com/AlexJanson/LekAanDek/releases)*
